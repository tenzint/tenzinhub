This is my 'MEVN' (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) full-stack web app. The server here will webscrape weather API, TTC API and show them to my Vue.js front end. I also plan to have some basic board games like 'Connect 4', and a Tibetan board game named 'Sho'. For this, I plan to implement a basic JWT-based authentication system and integrate socket.io for the games.
